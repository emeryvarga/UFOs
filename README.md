# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a dynamic webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. The webpage allows users to interact with data from UFO sightings by filtering the data based off of user inputs and displaying it in a neat table.


## Development Environment

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Results

* 37.6 % (90,398 / 240,124) of employees will be retiring in the near future
* 63.8 % (57,668 / 90,398) of retiring employees have senior titles
* 50.2 % (45,397/90,398) of retiring employees hold engineering positions
* 1.0 % (1,549 / (240,124 - 90,398)) of current employees are eligible for mentorship programs after retiring employees leave the company

## Summary

After taking an initial look at the results above, one might suggest that Perlett Hackard should recruit more employees and promote existing employees to fill the jobs left vacant by retirees. However, since automation can perform tasks that were once done by employees, Perlett Hackard should conduct more research to determine which positions truly need to be filled. Perlett Hackard should then enroll eligible employees into an Executive Development Program to fill senior titles once it's determined which positions are key to the company's success.

More than half of retiring employees hold engineering positions, so HR should pay special attention to recruiting engineers. One way this can be done is by representing the company in career fairs at engineering schools.

Furthermore, only 1.0% of employees are eligible to mentor after taking near-retirees out of the equation, so the company should expand their eligibility parameters.
